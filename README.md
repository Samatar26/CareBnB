## User story:
- As a young person living in London, I find accommodation ridiculously expensive and not good value for money. I want an app that allows me to search for cheaper accommodation in return of help around the house and good company.

## Requirements:
- [ ] I want to be able to search for accommodation based on location and according to the number of hours that I am available to help  
- [ ] I want to able to see: pictures of the room/house, pictures of the people I might be living with, their likes/dislikes and ground rules
- [ ] I want to be able to see the properties on a map
- [ ] I want to be able to see available properties without the hassle of signing up
- [ ] If I decide to sign up, I want the process to be as simple as possible - a prepopulated form would be great
- [ ] I want to easily go back to my initial search
